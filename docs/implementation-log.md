# Implementation Log

**Append-only. Never edit or remove an existing entry — corrections get a new dated entry that references the one being corrected.** This is the same convention as every other "don't rewrite history" rule in this doc series (ADR Amendment Logs, Clarifications, Pending-supersession notes), applied to actual code delivery instead of decisions.

This is the record that closes the loop `docs/adr/README.md`'s decisions and `docs/user-stories/README.md`'s stories don't close on their own: not just "this story is marked Done," but *which exact commit, in which repo, touching which exact files* did it — verifiable against git's own tamper-evident commit hash, not just trusted prose. See `docs/implementation-methodology.md`'s Conventions section and [`docs/templates/check-implementation-log.cjs`](templates/check-implementation-log.cjs), which independently recomputes each entry's file list from git and fails CI on a mismatch.

One entry per completed story or healing pass, added by the `implement-story` / `heal-contract-failure` skills as their final step, using this exact field set (the verification script parses on these bold labels):

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD — Story X.Y — <repo>@<short-hash>

- **Full commit:** `<full 40-character SHA>`
- **Repo:** social-listening-core | social-listening-admin
- **Story / ADR:** X.Y / ADR-00NN
- **Contract:** contracts/epic-N/story-X.Y.<slug>.contract.test.ts
- **SKILL.md:** .claude/skills/<component-slug>/SKILL.md
- **Files touched:** file1, file2, file3, ...
- **Full suite at merge:** PASS (N/N)
```

For a healing pass (no story number, or fixing a cross-component regression per that section of the methodology doc), use `## YYYY-MM-DD — Healing: <one-line description> — <repo>@<short-hash>` with the same field set, `Story / ADR` naming whichever story/ADR the healed contract belongs to.

**Merge strategy note:** use regular or fast-forward merges, not squash — the commit hash recorded here is written *before* merge (it's the PR branch's tip commit), and squashing would replace it with a different hash on `main`, silently invalidating the entry. See `docs/templates/ci-workflow.md`.

## 2026-07-29 — Story 1.1 — socialengage@8fa7a66

*Pre-split convention: `social-listening-core` and `social-listening-admin` don't yet exist as separate git repositories — per `CLAUDE.md`, they're subdirectories of this single `socialengage` workspace repo until the actual repo split happens. This commit necessarily touches both directories atomically, so `Repo` below names both rather than the single value the template above otherwise expects, and `Files touched` is the commit's true, undivided file list. `docs/templates/check-implementation-log.cjs`, once copied into either repo, filters entries by exact `Repo` match against its own directory name — a combined value like this one won't match either, so it will be silently skipped by that check until the real split happens, not falsely failed. Future Phase 0 commits that touch both scaffolds at once should follow this same convention.*

- **Full commit:** `8fa7a662a16c9eaff3522fb18bb12827911d524f`
- **Repo:** social-listening-core + social-listening-admin (pre-split, single workspace repo — see note above)
- **Story / ADR:** 1.1 / ADR-0001
- **Contract:** social-listening-core/contracts/epic-1/story-1.1.independent-repo-scaffold.contract.test.ts; social-listening-admin/contracts/epic-1/story-1.1.rest-only-boundary.contract.test.ts
- **SKILL.md:** social-listening-core/.claude/skills/repo-scaffold/SKILL.md; social-listening-admin/.claude/skills/core-api-client/SKILL.md
- **Files touched:** social-listening-admin/.claude/skills/core-api-client/SKILL.md, social-listening-admin/.gitignore, social-listening-admin/contracts/epic-1/story-1.1.rest-only-boundary.contract.test.ts, social-listening-admin/jest.config.js, social-listening-admin/package-lock.json, social-listening-admin/package.json, social-listening-admin/src/lib/core-client.ts, social-listening-admin/tsconfig.json, social-listening-core/.claude/skills/repo-scaffold/SKILL.md, social-listening-core/.gitignore, social-listening-core/contracts/epic-1/story-1.1.independent-repo-scaffold.contract.test.ts, social-listening-core/jest.config.js, social-listening-core/package-lock.json, social-listening-core/package.json, social-listening-core/tsconfig.json
- **Full suite at merge:** PASS (core 3/3, admin 6/6)

## 2026-07-29 — Story 1.2 + 5.4 — social-listening-core@bce8cfc

*Single-repo commit this time (every file is under `social-listening-core/`), but the same pre-split caveat from the Story 1.1 entry above still applies: paths below are workspace-relative (with the `social-listening-core/` prefix) because this directory has no separate git repository of its own yet — see that entry's note for the full explanation.*

- **Full commit:** `bce8cfc7d3733b8ae91ca5cb270b6e8991d81da7`
- **Repo:** social-listening-core
- **Story / ADR:** 1.2 / ADR-0016; 5.4 / ADR-0015
- **Contract:** social-listening-core/contracts/epic-1/story-1.2.postgres-jsonb.contract.test.ts; social-listening-core/contracts/epic-5/story-5.4.tenant-isolation-rls.contract.test.ts
- **SKILL.md:** social-listening-core/.claude/skills/postgres-tenant-db/SKILL.md
- **Files touched:** social-listening-core/.claude/skills/postgres-tenant-db/SKILL.md, social-listening-core/README.md, social-listening-core/contracts/epic-1/story-1.2.postgres-jsonb.contract.test.ts, social-listening-core/contracts/epic-5/story-5.4.tenant-isolation-rls.contract.test.ts, social-listening-core/docker-compose.test.yml, social-listening-core/jest.config.js, social-listening-core/jest.global-setup.js, social-listening-core/jest.global-teardown.js, social-listening-core/migrations/0001_create_social_posts.sql, social-listening-core/migrations/0002_enable_rls_social_posts.sql, social-listening-core/package-lock.json, social-listening-core/package.json, social-listening-core/src/db/migrate.ts, social-listening-core/src/db/pool.ts, social-listening-core/src/db/withTenant.ts
- **Full suite at merge:** PASS (9/9 — Story 1.1's 3 + Story 1.2's 3 + Story 5.4's 3)
