# Implementation Log

**Append-only. Never edit or remove an existing entry — corrections get a new dated entry that references the one being corrected.** This is the same convention as every other "don't rewrite history" rule in this doc series (ADR Amendment Logs, Clarifications, Pending-supersession notes), applied to actual code delivery instead of decisions.

This is the record that closes the loop `docs/adr/README.md`'s decisions and `docs/user-stories/README.md`'s stories don't close on their own: not just "this story is marked Done," but *which exact commit, in which repo, touching which exact files* did it — verifiable against git's own tamper-evident commit hash, not just trusted prose. See `docs/implementation-methodology.md`'s Conventions section and [`docs/templates/check-implementation-log.cjs`](templates/check-implementation-log.cjs), which independently recomputes each entry's file list from git and fails CI on a mismatch.

One entry per completed story or healing pass, added by the `implement-story` / `heal-contract-failure` skills as their final step, using this exact field set (the verification script parses on these bold labels):

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD — Story X.Y — <repo>@<short-hash>

- **Full commit:** `<full 40-character SHA>`
- **Repo:** social-listening-core | social-listening-admin
- **Story / ADR:** X.Y / ADR-00NN
- **Contract:** contracts/epic-N/story-X.Y.<slug>.contract.test.ts
- **SKILL.md:** .claude/skills/<component-slug>/SKILL.md
- **Files touched:** file1, file2, file3, ...
- **Full suite at merge:** PASS (N/N)
```

For a healing pass (no story number, or fixing a cross-component regression per that section of the methodology doc), use `## YYYY-MM-DD — Healing: <one-line description> — <repo>@<short-hash>` with the same field set, `Story / ADR` naming whichever story/ADR the healed contract belongs to.

**Merge strategy note:** use regular or fast-forward merges, not squash — the commit hash recorded here is written *before* merge (it's the PR branch's tip commit), and squashing would replace it with a different hash on `main`, silently invalidating the entry. See `docs/templates/ci-workflow.md`.

*No entries yet — nothing has been implemented. The first entry gets added by whichever skill closes the first story.*
